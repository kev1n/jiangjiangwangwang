# Summary
Our project is called Ducky Drive. Our idea is to implement a copy of Google Drive, using the lab machines as the storage backend. This will enable easy access to your files on the lab machines, and functionality like uploading, downloading, viewing, editing, deleting, and creating files will make file management as abstract as possible.
